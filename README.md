The CHIP-8 emulator
===================

**Current version:** 1.0-alpha-20200629

Overview
--------

This is a CHIP-8 emulator, implemented in C# and using .NET Framework 2.0.

Features
--------

* Customizable configuration.
    - Selectable system font.
    - Two buzzer sounds available.
    - Selectable processor speed.
    - Selectable foreground color.
* Fine tuning for program compatibility.
    - Automatic screen clear on reset.
    - Selectable behavior of `I` register on instructions `FX55` and `FX65`.
* Developer tools.
    - Basic cycle stepping mode (one processor cycle per invocation).
    - Memory viewer.
    - Register inspector.
    - Stack viewer.
    - Basic disassembler.

How to build
------------

This project has been coded using Visual Studio 2005. Later versions may work, but they are untested.

In order to produce a working program, build the project `UI-WinForms` or build the entire solution via `Ctrl+Shift+B`, using the "Release" configuration.

The folder `src\Chip8-NET20\UI-WinForms\bin\Release` will contain all components required to successfully run the program:

Planned
-------

* Implementation correctness.
    - Allow the user to select whether or not to use RAM for the stack.
* Customizable configuration.
    - Screen background color.
* Developer tools.
    - Make the disassembler follow the address being executed when cycle-stepping.
    - Provide interfaces to write values directly to RAM, the stack or registers/timers.
